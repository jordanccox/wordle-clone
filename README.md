# Wordle Clone

This is a simple clone of the popular web game Wordle.

It has most of its functionality right now, but is missing a few key elements that I will add as I have time, such as alert boxes for when the game has been won or lost.

To test it in its current form:

1. Download the files as a zip, open the zip folder, and open the index.html file in your browser.
2. Try to guess the 5 letter word by entering a word into the first row then pressing the "Enter" button or pressing "Enter" on your keyboard.
3. If you guess one of the letters of the word at the correct index, the square behind the correct letter will turn green. If you guess the right letter at an incorrect index, the square behind the letter will turn yellow.
4. If all squares turn green, you guessed the word correctly.
5. If you were unable to guess the word, press "Reset Game" to try again with a different, randomly selected word.
